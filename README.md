# worldbank_eda
An EDA based on World Bank's life expectancy statistics between 2000 and 2015. I have narrowed down this EDA to the Europe and the Netherlands specifically, as those regions will be my area of focus through my career. I have used Pandas for data analysis;and Seaborn and PowerBI for creating adequate visualizations. To this end, I have noticed an increasing trend -although small fluctutations occurred during those 15 year time period- in life expectancy all over the Europe, with Switzerland being the leader and Azerbaijan and Armenia being at the bottom of the list. Graphs will be at visualizations branch and reports will be at the essays branch.
